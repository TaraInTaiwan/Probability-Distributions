If the random variable X follows the binomial distribution. 
The probability of x successes in n independent Bernoulli trials as follow:

Distribution|Probability mass function|Mean
------|-------|------
  $X\sim \text{Bin}(n,p)$|$f(x)=\binom{n}{x}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}$    |$\text{E}(X)=np$

A binomial random variable is the sum of n independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter p.
The n successes occur with probability $p^{x}$ and $n-x$ failures occur with probability $(1-p)^{n-x}$, such as tossed a biased coin.
