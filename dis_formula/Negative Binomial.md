If the random variable X follows the negative binomial distribution. 

Distribution|Probability mass function|Mean
------|-------|------
$X\sim \text{NB}(r,p)$ |$f(x)=\binom{x+r-1}{r-1}p^{r}(1-p)^{x}$|$\text{E}(X)=\frac{rp}{1-p}$

Here r is the number of successes, x is the number of failures, and p is the probability of success.
